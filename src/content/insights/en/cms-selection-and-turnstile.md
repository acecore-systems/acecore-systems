  title: Frequently asked questions
  items:
    - question: What kind of site is Sveltia CMS good for?
      answer: It works well for static sites where Markdown or JSON lives in the repository, such as Astro, Hugo, and VitePress projects. You can add a CMS without adding an external database.
    - question: Can I use only a GitHub Personal Access Token?
      answer: Yes, but for multiple editors or non-engineers, an OAuth Worker is safer and easier to explain. Acecore uses a Cloudflare Worker as the OAuth client and sets it as backend.base_url.
    - question: Should every locale be editable in the CMS?
      answer: For a small team, it is safer to edit only the Japanese source in the CMS and update translations through pull requests. Exposing every locale makes review and stale-translation detection harder.

Sveltia CMS is a good fit when you want to add an editing screen to a static site without moving content into an external database. This guide explains how we introduced it to the Acecore Astro site and what we fixed later after real pull requests and commits exposed operational gaps.

> **Updated July 28, 2026:** Acecore now publishes CMS saves as validated direct commits to `main`. GitHub OAuth verifies the editor and current write permission, while a repository-specific GitHub App performs repository operations. The proxy synchronously validates JSON and Markdown schemas, image signatures, active HTML and URLs, and the expected HEAD before writing.

The title is intentionally simple: **Sveltia CMS Setup Guide**. This is not a CMS comparison article. It is a practical checklist for people who want to add Sveltia CMS to their own site.

## When Sveltia CMS Fits

Sveltia CMS is not a CMS that owns your database and serves content through a separate API. It is a single-page admin app that edits files in your Git repository through a backend such as GitHub.

It is a good match when:

- your site stores content as Markdown or JSON in the repository
- you want article, author, tag, and page-text changes to remain reviewable as Git diffs
- you do not want to add a database or a separate admin service
- uploaded images can live under a folder such as `public/uploads`
- CMS saves should start publication immediately while code changes remain protected by pull requests

If you need complex editorial permissions, large asset management, scheduled publishing workflows, or real-time data editing, a full headless CMS or a custom admin app may be a better fit.

## Overall Architecture

Acecore runs Sveltia CMS with this structure:

```text
public/admin/index.html
  -> loads @sveltia/cms from a CDN

public/admin/config.yml
  -> defines the GitHub backend, editable collections, and media folders

workers/sveltia-cms-auth
  -> Cloudflare Worker for GitHub OAuth

main branch
  -> the single source of truth for production

CMS save proxy
  -> validates allowed paths and content, then writes one expected-HEAD cms: commit to main

.github/workflows/submit-openai-translation-batch.yml
  -> batches Japanese-source updates for 15 minutes, then submits them to OpenAI Batch
```

The first lesson is that installing the admin app is only the beginning. Authentication, media paths, preview branches, translations, and merge strategy all become part of the CMS design.

## 1. Place the Admin App Under `public/admin`

In Astro, files under `public` are served as static assets. The Sveltia CMS docs also list `public` as the static folder for Astro, Next.js, Nuxt, Remix, and VitePress projects.

A minimal page looks like this:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="robots" content="noindex,nofollow" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>CMS</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@sveltia/cms@0.172.4/dist/sveltia-cms.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Do not add an extra stylesheet or `type="module"` unless you have a specific reason. Sveltia CMS bundles its UI styles in the JavaScript file, and the current CDN build is loaded as a normal script.

Acecore uses manual initialization so the backend can be overridden explicitly. The publication branch remains `main` in every environment.

```html
<script src="/admin/runtime-config.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@sveltia/cms@0.172.4/dist/sveltia-cms.js"></script>
<script src="/admin/init.js"></script>
```

```javascript
CMS.init({
  config: {
    backend: {
      branch: "main",
    },
  },
});
```

## 2. Configure the GitHub Backend

The minimal GitHub backend needs `backend.name` and `backend.repo`. In production, you should also decide the branch, OAuth endpoint, and commit messages up front.

```yaml
backend:
  name: github
  repo: owner/repository
  branch: main
  base_url: https://your-sveltia-cms-auth-worker.example.workers.dev
  api_root: /admin/api/github
  graphql_api_root: /admin/api/graphql
  auth_methods: [oauth]
  commit_messages:
    create: 'cms: create {{collection}} "{{slug}}"'
    update: 'cms: update {{collection}} "{{slug}}"'
    delete: 'cms: delete {{collection}} "{{slug}}"'
    uploadMedia: 'cms: upload "{{path}}"'
    deleteMedia: 'cms: delete media "{{path}}"'
```

Keep `main` as the publication branch and route reads and saves through a same-origin API proxy. Before every save, the proxy freshly verifies the GitHub user's write permission, then uses an `acecore-net`-specific GitHub App for repository access. It validates changed paths, JSON and Markdown schemas, image signatures, active HTML and URLs, and the latest `main` HEAD before creating one direct `cms:` commit.

As of July 28, 2026, Editorial Workflow is not implemented in Sveltia CMS. Acecore does not depend on Decap CMS's `publish_mode: editorial_workflow`; the same-origin proxy enforces scope, content validity, and conflicts.

A permanent branch such as `cms-content` creates ongoing synchronization, conflict, and deployment-source risks. Acecore keeps `main` as the only source of truth and rejects concurrent updates through `expectedHeadOid`.

## 3. Add an OAuth Worker

A Personal Access Token is enough for a quick local test. It is not ideal when non-engineers or multiple editors need access.

Acecore uses Sveltia CMS Authenticator on Cloudflare Workers and points `backend.base_url` to that Worker.

```yaml
backend:
  name: github
  repo: acecore-systems/acecore-net
  branch: main
  base_url: https://sveltia-cms-auth.example.workers.dev
  api_root: /admin/api/github
  graphql_api_root: /admin/api/graphql
  auth_methods: [oauth]
```

The GitHub OAuth App callback points to the Worker's `/callback` URL. The Worker receives `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`, and optionally `ALLOWED_DOMAINS` as environment variables.

This is separate from bot protection. Turnstile belongs around contact forms or comment APIs. CMS login should be handled through GitHub OAuth.

## 4. Decide the Media Folder Early

Sveltia CMS internal media storage writes uploaded assets into the repository. In Astro, public assets should usually live under `public`.

```yaml
media_folder: public/uploads
public_folder: /uploads
```

If this is not explicit, media can end up relative to a content folder, or the saved file path can diverge from the public URL referenced by Markdown.

Acecore later fixed this in [PR #116](https://github.com/acecore-systems/acecore-net/pull/116). The lesson is simple: decide the storage path and public URL together when the CMS is introduced.

We also keep external images and uploaded images as separate frontmatter fields.

```yaml
- name: image
  label: External image URL
  widget: string
  required: false

- name: uploadedImage
  label: Uploaded image
  widget: image
  required: false
```

## 5. Split Editable Content Into Collections

The most important design decision is not the CMS itself, but which files are editable through it.

| collection | Target                         | Policy                                            |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `blog`     | `src/content/blog/*.md`        | Edit only Japanese source articles                |
| `authors`  | `src/content/authors/*.json`   | Edit author profiles and localized names          |
| `tags`     | `src/content/tags/*.json`      | Edit tag names and localized labels               |
| page text  | `src/i18n/source/ja/**/*.json` | Edit Japanese source text for pages and shared UI |

The key is to avoid exposing all translated Markdown files in the CMS. For a nine-language site, that makes it harder to know which language is current and which translation should follow a Japanese source change.

Acecore treats Japanese content as the source of truth and sends translations through [How to Run a Multilingual Blog with Sveltia CMS](/en/blog/copilot-translation-pipeline/).

## 6. Use Relation and Select Widgets

The more free text fields you expose, the more small mistakes you will get.

Tags are relation fields, not manually typed strings.

```yaml
- name: tags
  label: Tags
  widget: relation
  collection: tags
  value_field: name
  display_fields: ["{{name}} ({{id}})"]
  search_fields: [name, id]
  multiple: true
  required: false
```

Authors use the same pattern. Announcement tone, link-card icons, and other constrained values are select fields.

This was improved over time. A CMS should not merely make editing possible; it should make invalid values hard to enter.

## 7. Make Japanese Source JSON Editable

CMS editing is also useful for fixed page text. Acecore stores Japanese page text under `src/i18n/source/ja/**/*.json` and exposes it in page-oriented groups.

The lesson from implementation was to avoid adding every field at once. After making page text editable, we had to stabilize existing value loading and label organization. Start with high-change areas like the blog, authors, tags, announcements, and key landing pages, then expand.

For multilingual sites, do not let CMS edits directly rewrite translation files. Keeping Japanese source edits and translation pull requests separate makes review much easier.

## 8. Keep Writer Credentials in Production Only

Configure the GitHub App client ID, installation ID, and private key only in the Cloudflare Pages production environment. Do not distribute writer credentials to previews; repository reads and writes remain disabled there. Editors save and publish from the production `/admin/`, while Pages previews remain for normal code and CMS-configuration pull requests.

Acecore generates `public/admin/runtime-config.js` before builds to enable manual initialization only:

```javascript
await writeFile(
  "public/admin/runtime-config.js",
  "window.CMS_MANUAL_INIT = true;\n",
  "utf8",
);
```

Then `init.js` overrides only the backend branch.

```javascript
CMS.init({
  config: {
    backend: {
      branch: "main",
    },
  },
});
```

The production publication branch stays fixed to `main`, and the proxy rejects requests based on any other branch. Preview configuration still displays `main` for consistency checks, but cannot save without writer credentials.

## 9. Validate and Publish Directly with a Save Proxy

Treat CMS Save as the start of publication. A same-origin proxy synchronously validates the allowed scope and content, then creates exactly one commit on `main`.

```yaml
backend:
  name: github
  repo: owner/repository
  branch: main
  api_root: /admin/api/github
  graphql_api_root: /admin/api/graphql
```

The proxy does not blindly forward GraphQL `createCommitOnBranch`. GitHub OAuth freshly verifies the editor and write permission, while a short-lived installation token from an `acecore-net`-specific GitHub App performs repository reads and writes. Only allowlisted content and images are accepted; JSON and Markdown schemas, image magic bytes, and active HTML or URLs are checked before the commit. SVG and PDF uploads are rejected.

The save uses the editor's starting HEAD as `expectedHeadOid`, so a concurrent update returns 409 instead of being overwritten. If GitHub's response is lost, recovery succeeds only when the request marker, parent SHA, complete path set, and blob SHAs all match.

Direct commits keep subjects such as `cms: create ...` and `cms: update ...`. The GitHub App push starts Cloudflare Pages deployment and the translation workflow in parallel. Code, schemas, workflows, CMS configuration, and translation files remain outside the CMS allowlist and still require pull requests and CI.

## 10. Trigger Translation Only for CMS Commits

If every Japanese source change triggers translation tasks, normal development commits can create unnecessary translation PRs.

[PR #98](https://github.com/acecore-systems/acecore-net/pull/98) added the `--cms-only` guard so push-triggered translation tasks are created only for CMS commit subjects.

```javascript
function isCmsCommitSubject(subject) {
  return /^cms: (create|update|delete) /.test(subject || "");
}
```

This makes the commit subject part of the workflow contract. Normal code or article PRs should not use the `cms:` prefix. Only the CMS save flow should produce it.

## 11. Give `/admin` Its Own CSP

The admin screen needs different external connections than public pages: the Sveltia CMS CDN, GitHub API, the OAuth Worker, blob URLs, and status endpoints.

Acecore gives `/admin/*` a separate CSP and also marks the admin area as noindex.

```text
/admin/*
  X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow
  Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://unpkg.com; connect-src 'self' blob: data: https://unpkg.com https://api.github.com https://www.githubstatus.com https://sveltia-cms-auth.example.workers.dev; frame-ancestors 'self'
```

## Keep Turnstile Separate

An older version of this article mixed CMS selection and Cloudflare Turnstile in one story. That was confusing.

Sveltia CMS setup is about GitHub backend, OAuth, collections, media paths, and pull request operations. Turnstile is about protecting contact forms or comment APIs from bot submissions. They both support safer operations, but they live in different layers and deserve separate articles.

## Lessons From Pull Requests and Commits

The biggest lessons came after the first setup landed.

### 1. Update Articles When the CMS Changes

The site moved from an older Pages CMS assumption to Sveltia CMS, but the article text did not keep up. When the implementation changes, related articles, screenshots, and internal link text should be audited together.

### 2. Do Not Postpone OAuth

PAT-based testing is fine, but CMS exists so more people can edit content. OAuth should be part of the real setup, not a future improvement.

### 3. Fix Media Paths Before Editors Upload Images

Changing media paths later means auditing existing Markdown references and generated output. For Astro, `public/uploads` and `/uploads` are a practical default.

### 4. Expand CMS Fields Gradually

Putting every page text field into `config.yml` at once makes the config hard to review and maintain. Start with content that changes often, then add lower-frequency page text later.

### 5. Treat Commit Subjects as an API

`cms:` is not cosmetic. It is an input to automation. Only the direct-publish proxy should produce that prefix; using it outside the CMS flow can trigger unnecessary workflows.

### 6. Do Not Switch the Publication Branch by Environment

Giving a preview deployment a writer credential that can bypass the ruleset creates another route into production `main`. Restrict editing and saving to the production `/admin/`, then confirm the production deployment after saving. Use Cloudflare Pages previews without writer credentials for normal code or configuration pull requests.

## Minimal Starting Point

For a new Astro site, start with this shape:

```text
public/admin/index.html
public/admin/config.yml
public/admin/init.js
public/admin/runtime-config.js
```

```yaml
backend:
  name: github
  repo: owner/repository
  branch: main
  base_url: https://your-auth-worker.example.workers.dev
  api_root: /admin/api/github
  graphql_api_root: /admin/api/graphql
  auth_methods: [oauth]
  commit_messages:
    create: 'cms: create {{collection}} "{{slug}}"'
    update: 'cms: update {{collection}} "{{slug}}"'
    delete: 'cms: delete {{collection}} "{{slug}}"'

media_folder: public/uploads
public_folder: /uploads

collections:
  - name: blog
    label: Blog
    folder: src/content/blog
    slug: "{{fields._slug}}"
    fields:
      - { name: title, label: Title, widget: string }
      - { name: description, label: Description, widget: text }
      - { name: date, label: Published date, widget: datetime }
      - { name: author, label: Author, widget: string }
      - { name: body, label: Body, widget: markdown }
```

From there, add author relations, tag relations, uploaded images, source JSON editing, synchronous direct-publish validation, and translation PR tasks in that order.

## Summary

Sveltia CMS is easy to place under `public/admin`, but a production setup needs more than an admin page.

Decide the save branch, OAuth flow, media folders, source-language policy, translation workflow, and merge strategy. Once those are explicit, a static Astro site can stay lightweight while gaining a usable editing workflow.

For translation automation, see [How to Run a Multilingual Blog with Sveltia CMS](/en/blog/copilot-translation-pipeline/). The CMS is the content-update foundation that makes both workflows easier to operate.

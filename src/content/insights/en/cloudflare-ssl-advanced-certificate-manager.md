  title: Frequently Asked Questions
  items:
    - question: Can I use a wildcard certificate (*.example.com) with Universal SSL?
      answer: Yes, but it only covers first-level subdomains such as www.example.com. It does not apply to second-level or deeper subdomains like dev.staging.example.com, which causes certificate errors. ACM is required in that case.
    - question: Can I use Advanced Certificate Manager on the free plan?
      answer: Yes. Even on Cloudflare’s free plan, you can use ACM by purchasing the ACM add-on ($10/month/zone). Upgrading to a higher plan is not required.
    - question: When is Universal SSL sufficient?
      answer: For most personal and small business sites, Universal SSL is enough. If you only use the root domain and first-level subdomains like www, ACM is not necessary.
    - question: What happens to Universal SSL after enabling ACM?
      answer: Universal SSL and ACM can coexist. For the same subdomain, ACM certificates are used with priority.

“Wait, what was Cloudflare’s paid SSL option called again?” — many people have wondered this. In this article, we’ll clarify what it is and what it’s called today.

## Conclusion: “Dedicated SSL” → “Advanced Certificate Manager (ACM)”

Cloudflare’s former paid SSL option was **Dedicated SSL Certificates**. In **2021, it was revamped and renamed as “Advanced Certificate Manager (ACM)”**.

The price remains the same as before: **$10/month per zone (domain)**.

---

## Why the name changed

In the “Dedicated SSL” era, the feature focused on issuing certificates dedicated to a specific domain. While free Universal SSL shared certificates across multiple sites, dedicated certificates offered your own common name (CN).

With the transition to **Advanced Certificate Manager**, the following capabilities were added, and the name shifted to emphasize certificate “management.”

- **Multi-level subdomain support**: Protect deeper subdomains such as `dev.staging.example.com`
- **CA selection**: Choose from Let's Encrypt, Google Trust Services, and more
- **Custom validity period**: Configure from 14 to 365 days
- **Up to 50 hostnames**: Cover multiple hostnames with one certificate
- **Total TLS**: Automatically protect all proxied subdomains in the zone

---

## Differences from Universal SSL

Cloudflare provides free **Universal SSL**, and for most sites this alone enables HTTPS. However, there are some limitations.

### Cases Universal SSL cannot cover

```
# Covered by Universal SSL
example.com
www.example.com
blog.example.com

# Not covered by Universal SSL (ACM required)
dev.staging.example.com
api.v2.example.com
deep.sub.domain.example.com
```

The wildcard `*.example.com` works, but **it only applies to first-level subdomains**. Multi-level patterns like `*.staging.example.com` are not supported.

### Cloudflare branding in certificates

With Universal SSL, the certificate CN may include a Cloudflare domain such as `sni.cloudflaressl.com`. With ACM, your own domain becomes the CN and Cloudflare branding is hidden.

---

## When ACM is needed

Consider ACM if any of the following applies:

1. **You use multi-level subdomains**
   You need SSL for second-level or deeper subdomains, such as `api.staging.example.com` or `dev.app.example.com`.

2. **You want your own domain as the certificate CN**
   You want to remove Cloudflare branding from certificates (common for corporate and B2B services).

3. **You want to specify CA or validity period**
   Your security policy requires a specific CA, or you need short-lived certificates (e.g., 14 days).

4. **You want to protect all subdomains at once with Total TLS**
   You want automatic certificate coverage for all proxied subdomains in the zone.

---

## Purchase and activation steps

You can enable it in a few steps from the Cloudflare dashboard:

1. Open the target domain in the Cloudflare dashboard
2. Go to **SSL/TLS** → **Edge Certificates**
3. In the **Advanced Certificate Manager** section, click **Enable**
4. Confirm and purchase the subscription ($10/month)
5. Create a certificate and add hostnames you want to protect

If you want to enable Total TLS, simply turn it On in the **Total TLS** section on the same Edge Certificates page.

| CN as your own domain   | △                        | ✓                                             |
| Total TLS               | ✗                        | ✓                                             |
| Best for                | Personal / general sites | Enterprise / complex subdomain setups         |

Cloudflare’s “former paid SSL option” is **Advanced Certificate Manager (formerly Dedicated SSL Certificates)**. It is especially useful when free Universal SSL is not enough—particularly for protecting multi-level subdomains and gaining fine-grained certificate control.

  title: Frequently Asked Questions
  items:
    - question: Is GitHub Copilot Agent Mode free to use?
      answer: "The GitHub Copilot Free plan has monthly usage limits for Agent Mode. Pro and Business plans have relaxed limits. The latest features are available early in VS Code Insiders."
    - question: Can the same approach be used with browser tools other than Playwright?
      answer: "We use VS Code's built-in browser tools (Simple Browser + Playwright integration). Since Copilot directly operates the browser via the run_playwright_code tool, there's no need to install Playwright separately."
    - question: Can this be applied to non-static sites?
      answer: "Yes. The same approach works for SPAs and SSR sites. However, pages requiring login authentication need a mechanism to securely manage test credentials."
    - question: Can the AI also fix bugs it discovers?
      answer: "In Agent Mode, file read/write is possible, so the entire flow from bug detection to fixing and build verification can be completed within a single session. In this article, we discovered 2 bugs and fixed them on the spot."

## Introduction

Website quality assurance is not sufficient with a one-time check before release. Unexpected issues can arise at any point—content additions, library updates, CDN configuration changes, and more.

This article documents a hands-on monkey testing session where **VS Code Agent Mode (GitHub Copilot)** directly operated a browser to test an entire site. We've systematized the testing methodology that AI consistently executed, from static source code analysis to dynamic browser verification.

---

## Test Environment

| Item            | Details                                                  |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Editor          | VS Code + GitHub Copilot (Agent Mode)                    |
| AI Model        | Claude Opus 4.6                                          |
| Browser Control | VS Code built-in Playwright tools                        |
| Test Target     | Static site built with Astro + UnoCSS + Cloudflare Pages |
| Preview         | `npm run preview` (local) + production URL               |

In Agent Mode, Copilot autonomously executes terminal commands, reads/writes files, and operates the browser. The tester simply instructs "please test," and the AI automatically executes the entire process below.

---

## Phase 1: Test Target Inventory

### Full Source Code Read

The AI first scans the project's directory structure and reads all source code for components, pages, and utilities.

```
src/
├── components/    ← All 28 components read
├── content/blog/  ← Frontmatter of 23 articles parsed
├── pages/         ← All routing files identified
├── layouts/       ← BaseLayout structure understood
└── utils/         ← rehype plugins & OG image generation reviewed
```

At this stage, the AI automatically identifies:

- **Full route list**: 7 static pages + blog-related routes (articles, tags, archive, authors, pagination)
- **Interactive elements**: Search modal, FAQ toggles, copy buttons, YouTube facade, scroll-to-top, hero slider
- **External integrations**: ssgform.com (forms), Cloudflare Turnstile (bot protection), Google AdSense, GA4

### Automatic Test Plan Generation

From the source code analysis results, the AI automatically generates a test plan as a Todo list. No need for humans to create checklists.

---

## Phase 2: Full Route Crawl Testing

### HTTP Status Verification

The built site is launched with `npm run preview`, and Playwright accesses all routes.

```
Test targets: 38 routes
├── Static pages       7 (/, /about/, /services/, etc.)
├── Blog posts        23
├── Tag pages         25
├── Archive            5
├── Pagination         2 (/blog/page/2/, /blog/page/3/)
├── Author pages       2
├── RSS                1
└── 404 test           1

Result: All routes 200 OK (except intentional 404)
```

### DOM Structure Check

The following are automatically verified on each page:

| Check Item            | Verification Method                            | Result       |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Broken images         | `img.complete && img.naturalWidth === 0`       | 0 found      |
| Empty links           | `href` is empty, `#`, or unset                 | 0 found      |
| Unsafe external links | `target="_blank"` without `rel="noopener"`     | 0 found      |
| H1 count              | `document.querySelectorAll('h1').length === 1` | All pages OK |
| Skip link             | Presence of "Skip to content"                  | All pages OK |
| lang attribute        | `html[lang="ja"]`                              | All pages OK |

### Dead Link Check

Internal links were recursively collected from the entry page, confirming reachability of all 69 unique URLs. **0 dead links** were found.

---

## Phase 3: Interaction Verification

The AI directly manipulates browser elements with Playwright to verify JavaScript-powered functionality.

### FAQ (`<details>` elements)

```javascript
// Example test code executed by the AI
const details = document.querySelectorAll("details");
// Initial state: all closed → OK
// Click to open → OK
// Click again to close → OK
```

### Search Modal (Pagefind)

1. Open search dialog with `window.openSearch()`
2. Wait for Pagefind UI to finish loading
3. Enter "Astro" and confirm search results appear
4. Confirm closing with ESC key

### YouTube Facade Pattern

1. Click the `.yt-facade` element
2. Confirm an iframe for `youtube-nocookie.com/embed/` is dynamically generated
3. Confirm the `autoplay=1` parameter is included

### Copy Button (After View Transitions)

Confirmed that code block copy buttons are re-initialized and functional **after** page transitions via View Transitions. The re-registration via the `astro:page-load` event was working correctly.

### ScrollToTop Button

Scroll to the bottom of the page → button appears → click → confirm `window.scrollY` returns to 0.

---

## Phase 4: SEO & Structured Data Audit

### OGP Meta Tags

The following were verified on all pages:

- `og:title` / `og:description` / `og:image` / `og:url` / `og:type` are set
- `twitter:card` is set to `summary_large_image`
- `canonical` URL is correct
- OG image URL exists and is the recommended size (1200×630)

### Structured Data (JSON-LD)

JSON-LD on each page was parsed to verify schema types and content.

| Page Type         | Structured Data                                     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| All pages         | Organization, WebSite                               |
| Blog posts        | BreadcrumbList, BlogPosting, FAQPage                |
| Articles with FAQ | FAQPage (mainEntity contains questions and answers) |

### Sitemap

Confirmed that `sitemap-index.xml` → `sitemap-0.xml` contains all 288 URLs, including multilingual pages. The sitemap reference from `robots.txt` was also working correctly.

---

## Phase 5: Accessibility Verification

AXE engine-equivalent checks were run via Playwright on multiple pages.

| Check Item                         | Pages Tested | Violations |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| img alt attributes                 | 4            | 0          |
| button labels                      | 4            | 0          |
| Heading hierarchy (h1→h2→h3 order) | 4            | 0          |
| Form input labels                  | 1 (Contact)  | 0          |
| Landmark elements                  | 4            | 0          |
| External link rel attributes       | 4            | 0          |
| tabindex values                    | 4            | 0          |

**Zero violations across all 4 pages and all check items.**

---

## Phase 6: View Transitions Navigation Testing

With Astro View Transitions, the DOM is differentially updated, making JavaScript re-initialization a challenge. The following transition patterns were verified:

```
Home → Blog List → Article → Tag → Author → Contact → Services → Home
```

Items confirmed after each transition:

- URL, title, and H1 are correctly updated
- Search button works
- Copy buttons are re-initialized
- Breadcrumb navigation is updated
- **Zero JS errors**

---

## Phase 7: Security Header Verification

Verification of response headers on the production site:

| Header                    | Value                           | Rating |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------ |
| Content-Security-Policy   | Fully configured                | ◎      |
| X-Frame-Options           | SAMEORIGIN                      | ◎      |
| X-Content-Type-Options    | nosniff                         | ◎      |
| Strict-Transport-Security | max-age=15552000                | ○      |
| Referrer-Policy           | strict-origin-when-cross-origin | ◎      |
| Permissions-Policy        | geolocation=(), camera=(), etc. | ◎      |

---

## Discovered Bugs and Fixes

This test session uncovered 2 bugs, both fixed within the same session.

### Bug 1: Search Modal Lacks Resilience

**Symptom**: If the search button is pressed before the Pagefind script finishes loading, the UI becomes unresponsive.

**Cause**: `loadPagefindScript()` had no retry mechanism after an initial failure.

**Fix**: Implemented clearing the Promise cache on failure and displaying a "Reload" button as fallback UI.

### Bug 2: Missing Google Origins in CSP Header

**Symptom**: Google AdSense-related resources are blocked by CSP, causing console errors.

**Cause**: `connect-src` and `frame-src` did not include `https://www.google.com` / `https://www.google.co.jp`.

**Fix**: Added Google-related origins to the CSP directives in `public/_headers`.

## Systematizing the Testing Methodology

Organizing this AI monkey testing approach, it can be classified into the following layers:

### Layer 1: Static Analysis (Source Code Reading)

- Directory structure scanning
- Component dependency mapping
- Frontmatter schema (Zod) analysis
- CSP and redirect configuration review

### Layer 2: HTTP Layer Testing (Full Route Crawl)

- Status code verification (200/404/301)
- Response header audit (security, cache)
- Sitemap, robots.txt, ads.txt consistency

### Layer 3: DOM Layer Testing (Structure Verification)

- Broken images, empty links, unsafe external links
- H1 uniqueness and heading hierarchy
- Meta tags (OGP, canonical, description)
- Structured data (JSON-LD)

### Layer 4: Interaction Layer Testing (Behavior Verification)

- Click, input, keyboard operations
- Modal open/close, form validation
- JS re-initialization after View Transitions
- Scroll events, lazy loading

### Layer 5: Accessibility Layer Testing

- alt attributes, labels, ARIA
- Heading hierarchy, landmarks
- Focus management, tabindex
- Skip links

## Limitations and Constraints

AI monkey testing has several limitations:

| Constraint           | Details                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Viewport emulation   | Mobile-width emulation doesn't work in VS Code's built-in browser. CSS validity was verified through static analysis of build output instead |
| Network conditions   | Offline and slow connection simulation not possible. Service Worker testing also not covered                                                 |
| User "feel"          | Design beauty, readability, and brand consistency require human judgment                                                                     |
| Authentication flows | Pages requiring login need separate secure credential management                                                                             |

For CSS responsive design, we substituted by directly analyzing CSS files in the build output, confirming that `@media(min-width:768px)` media queries were correctly generated.

## Summary

GitHub Copilot Agent Mode can complete an entire QA cycle—from source code analysis → test planning → automated browser operation → bug fixing → re-verification—starting from a single instruction: "please test."

Here's a summary of this session's results:

- **Test targets**: 38 routes + 25 tags + 5 archives + 2 pagination = 70 routes
- **Test items**: HTTP status, DOM structure, interactions, SEO, accessibility, security, View Transitions
- **Bugs found**: 2 (search modal, CSP header) → fixed on the spot
- **Accessibility violations**: 0
- **Dead links**: 0

Combining human visual inspection with AI automated verification achieves both test coverage and efficiency.

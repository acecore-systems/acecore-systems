  items:
    - question: Where should I start?
      answer: "Start with Astro static pages, blog, RSS, sitemap, and OGP. Then add CMS editing and localization. Add AI chat, service CTAs, and comments only when the contact flow or community workflow needs them."
    - question: Should every feature be Cloudflare-only?
      answer: "No. The AI contact chat uses the OpenAI API. The point is to keep delivery, API boundaries, storage, and bot protection inside a clear Cloudflare-centered architecture, while being deliberate about outside services."
    - question: Is this necessary for a small site?
      answer: "Not all at once. But if a site may later add CMS editing, localization, contact automation, or comments, it helps to decide URLs, storage, preview behavior, and search indexing early."

When you start with Astro and Cloudflare Pages, fast static delivery is usually enough.

As the site grows, you may want browser-based editing, localized pages, AI chat guidance, form handoff from service pages, and comments.

This article is an **implementation index** for deciding which layer each feature belongs to, which order to add them in, and which detailed guide to read next. The Acecore website is the example, but the pattern applies to other Astro + Cloudflare sites.

## The Short Version

The important split is this:

| Layer       | Responsibility                                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Astro       | Pages, blog, OGP, RSS, sitemap, UI               |
| Cloudflare  | Pages delivery, Pages Functions, D1, Turnstile   |
| GitHub      | PR review, CMS diffs, translation diffs, history |
| Sveltia CMS | Japanese source content, authors, tags, images   |
| OpenAI API  | AI contact chat responses                        |
| Pagefind    | Search indexing for reviewed static HTML         |

Static content stays static. Dynamic behavior is added only where a request-time boundary is actually useful.

## Start With Static Strength

Most of a company website does not need a server on every request.

Services, company information, case studies, blog posts, author pages, tag pages, RSS, sitemap, and OGP can all be generated at build time.

Astro owns that static surface. Cloudflare Pages delivers it.

Only features such as AI chat and comment posting need runtime APIs. Those go to Cloudflare Pages Functions.

## Keep Dynamic Features at Small API Boundaries

The AI contact chat and the comment API share the same pattern:

| Feature    | UI    | API Boundary      | Storage or External API |
| ---------- | ----- | ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| AI chat    | Astro | `/api/ai-contact` | OpenAI API              |
| Comments   | Astro | `/api/comments`   | Cloudflare D1           |
| Bot checks | UI    | Pages Functions   | Cloudflare Siteverify   |

Astro renders the interface. Secrets, API keys, D1 bindings, Turnstile secrets, hash salts, Origin checks, and rate limits stay server-side.

The site does not become a full application server. It remains static by default.

## CMS Is an Editing Surface, Not the Runtime Database

Sveltia CMS was added so content can be edited in a browser, but the CMS is not the runtime database.

It creates Git changes:

- Japanese blog source
- authors
- tags
- Japanese source JSON
- images

Those changes go through GitHub PRs, build checks, and review before reaching production.

That design keeps static-site operations reviewable.

## Localization Is Generated Content, Not UI Translation

The multilingual workflow keeps Japanese as the source and generates localized Markdown through PRs.

This creates actual URLs, titles, descriptions, OGP metadata, JSON-LD, RSS entries, sitemap entries, and hreflang links for each locale.

That is different from translating the UI at display time.

## Contact Paths Have Different Jobs

The contact area is not one button repeated in several places.

| Visitor state                      | Path        |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Unsure which service fits          | AI chat     |
| Already reading a specific service | Service CTA |
| Ready to submit details            | Form        |
| Wants a lightweight conversation   | LINE        |

The AI chat helps visitors choose. Service CTAs preserve context. The form records the actual request.

## AI Output Is Not Trusted HTML

The AI chat can return Markdown-like text, but that output is not trusted HTML.

The renderer only supports the Markdown needed for the chat, trims href values, checks them against an allowlist, and creates links through DOM APIs. Unsafe links fall back to text.

This is part of the architecture, not a cosmetic detail.

## Comments Stay Inside Cloudflare

The blog comments are intentionally not an embedded third-party widget.

Cloudflare Pages Functions handle GET and POST, D1 stores comments, Turnstile protects submissions, and host allowlists/rate limits decide what is accepted.

For a small company blog, that is enough without turning the site into a community platform.

## Searchable Content and Interaction Are Separate

Reviewed article content is indexed. Comments are not included in Pagefind.

That separation matters. User submissions, AI chat logs, forms, and admin screens are not the same thing as reviewed public content.

The architecture decides what is part of the public knowledge surface and what remains interaction or operation.

## Start by Goal

You do not need to read everything first. Start from the feature you are trying to add.

| Goal                                             | Read first                                                                                         |

## Implementation Order

For a similar site, the practical order is:

1. Build static pages, blog, RSS, sitemap, and OGP with Astro.
2. Add Sveltia CMS for the Japanese source content.
3. Generate localized pages as static HTML.
4. Add AI chat guidance and service CTAs.
5. Lock down Markdown links, form prefill, Origin checks, and rate limits.
6. Add comments inside Cloudflare only when comments are actually needed.

## Summary

Astro + Cloudflare can support much more than a simple company brochure without giving up the strengths of static delivery.

The key is to split responsibilities clearly: Astro builds reviewed public HTML, Cloudflare owns delivery and small API boundaries, Sveltia CMS edits source content, GitHub PRs review changes, OpenAI helps with contact guidance, and comments stay within Cloudflare when that is enough.

Use this page as the entry point, then add only the pieces your site actually needs without weakening the static foundation.

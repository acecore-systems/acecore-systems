  title: FAQ
  items:
    - question: What are the benefits of migrating from VitePress to Starlight?
      answer: If your main site runs on Astro, unifying the framework reduces learning costs, simplifies dependency management, and improves configuration consistency. You can also consolidate build pipelines.
    - question: How are Mermaid diagrams rendered?
      answer: We switched from plugin dependency to loading Mermaid via CDN (jsdelivr). This eliminates build dependencies entirely and delivers stable diagram rendering.
    - question: How much effort does the migration take?
      answer: The main tasks are converting the directory structure (docs/ → src/content/docs/) and adjusting frontmatter. Since the content itself is Markdown, it can be reused as-is, making the migration relatively quick.

Here's a walkthrough of migrating a VitePress documentation site to Astro + Starlight. If your main site runs on Astro, unifying your docs under Starlight simplifies operations. We also cover migrating Mermaid diagrams to CDN.

## Why Unify Frameworks?

Using different frameworks for the main site and documentation site creates the following problems:

- **Doubled learning costs**: You need to understand both VitePress and Astro specifications
- **Scattered dependencies**: npm package updates managed across two separate systems
- **Configuration inconsistency**: ESLint, Prettier, deploy settings, etc. maintained independently

Unifying on Astro + Starlight enables sharing configuration file patterns and troubleshooting knowledge.

## Migration Steps: VitePress to Starlight

### 1. Project Structure Conversion

VitePress places documents in the `docs/` directory, while Starlight uses `src/content/docs/`.

```
# Before (VitePress)
docs/
  pages/
    index.md
    business-overview.md
    market-analysis.md

# After (Starlight)
src/
  content/
    docs/
      index.md
      business-overview.md
      market-analysis.md
```

### 2. Frontmatter Adjustments

VitePress and Starlight have slightly different frontmatter formats. We migrated VitePress's `sidebar` configuration to Starlight's frontmatter `sidebar` field.

```yaml
# Starlight frontmatter
---
title: Business Overview
sidebar:
  order: 1
---
```

### 3. astro.config.mjs Configuration

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import starlight from "@astrojs/starlight";

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    starlight({
      title: "Acecore Business Plan",
      defaultLocale: "ja",
      sidebar: [
        {
          label: "Business Plan",
          autogenerate: { directory: "/" },
        },
      ],
    }),
  ],
});
```

### 4. Removing UnoCSS

In the VitePress environment, UnoCSS was used for custom styles, but Starlight comes with sufficient built-in default styles. We removed `uno.config.ts` and related packages, slimming down the dependencies.

## Mermaid Diagram CDN Migration

The business plan documents use Mermaid for flowcharts and organizational diagrams. In VitePress, Mermaid was integrated via a plugin (`vitepress-plugin-mermaid`), but no such plugin exists for Starlight.

So we switched to loading Mermaid from a CDN on the browser side.

### Implementation

Add the Mermaid CDN script to Starlight's custom head:

```javascript
// astro.config.mjs
starlight({
  head: [
    {
      tag: "script",
      attrs: { type: "module" },
      content: `
        import mermaid from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid@11.16.0/dist/mermaid.esm.min.mjs'
        mermaid.initialize({ startOnLoad: true })
      `,
    },
  ],
});
```

Standard Mermaid syntax works as-is in Markdown:

````markdown
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Business Plan] --> B[Market Analysis]
    A --> C[Sales Strategy]
    A --> D[Financial Plan]
```
````

### Benefits of the CDN Approach

- **Zero build dependencies**: Mermaid as an npm package is no longer needed
- **Always up to date**: Fetches the latest version from CDN
- **No SSR required**: Rendered in the browser, so no impact on build time

## Migration Results

| Item         | Before                   | After                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Framework    | VitePress 1.x            | Astro 6 + Starlight          |
| CSS          | UnoCSS                   | Starlight built-in           |
| Mermaid      | vitepress-plugin-mermaid | CDN (jsdelivr)               |
| Build output | `docs/.vitepress/dist`   | `dist`                       |
| Deployment   | Cloudflare Pages         | Cloudflare Pages (unchanged) |

By unifying frameworks, `astro.config.mjs` configuration patterns and deployment settings can be shared across multiple projects.

## Conclusion

Framework unification may not be "urgent," but the longer you operate, the more it pays off. The migration from VitePress to Starlight itself can be completed in a few hours, and the CDN approach for Mermaid is actually a liberation from plugin management. If you're running multiple projects, consider unifying your tech stack.
